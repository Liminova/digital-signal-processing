# digital-signal-processing

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `poetry` installed for dependencies management

## Usage

This repository uses `poetry` to manage its dependencies. If you don't already
have `poetry` installed, follow the install instructions
[here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

Afterwards, you can automatically setup the virtual environment with all the
dependencies by running:

```shell
$ poetry install
```

Everything else can be ran under the virtual environment with:

```shell
$ poetry run <command>
```

Or alternatively, if you need a shell environment for the virtual environment:

```shell
$ poetry shell
```
